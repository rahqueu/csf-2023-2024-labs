Hi Eva,

I'm thrilled that you're on board with our vacation plans. It's going to be absolutely magical! I mean, that Bora Bora place looks magical!

Your sweet words and lovely thoughts about our future together always warm my heart. I can't wait for the day we can make those dreams come true.

About the token of appreciation, I wanted to clarify that it's a gesture of gratitude not just for your hard work on the project but also as a little something extra because you hold a special place in my heart. ðŸ˜˜

Can't wait for our getaway and to create wonderful memories together.

Take care,
Rodrigo CabaÃ§o
