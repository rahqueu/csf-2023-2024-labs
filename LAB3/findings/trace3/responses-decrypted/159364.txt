Dear Diary,

Today, I'm beginning a new chapter in my life by starting this journal. I'm not entirely sure what prompted me to pick up a pen and put my thoughts on paper, but I believe it's time to face my emotions, my stress, and the weight of recent painful events.

Life has a way of throwing curveballs when you least expect it, and over the past few months, I've been overwhelmed by the demands of my dual life as both the President of Instituto Superior Técnico and my other endeavors. The expectations and responsibilities are relentless, and the pressure has been building steadily.

Moreover, there have been personal trials, losses, and disappointments that have weighed heavily on my heart. It's as if the weight of the world has settled upon my shoulders, and I find myself carrying it day in and day out. It's no way to live.

So, here I am, pen in hand, in the hope that writing down my thoughts, fears, and hopes will help me navigate this storm. They say that sharing your burdens with paper is akin to unburdening your soul. I'm not sure if that's entirely true, but I'm willing to give it a try.

In these pages, I hope to find solace, to process the challenges I face, and perhaps even find moments of clarity. It's a small step, but one that I hope will lead to healing and personal growth.

As I embark on this journey, I promise myself honesty and vulnerability, even if only in the quiet confines of these pages. Perhaps, in time, I will look back on these entries as markers of my progress, a testament to my resilience in the face of adversity.

Here's to new beginnings and the potential for healing.

Until tomorrow,
Rodri

Dear Diary,

It's been an eventful day, one filled with the responsibilities of my role as the President of Instituto Superior Técnico. Being at the helm of this prestigious university is both an honor and a significant challenge. Today was a microcosm of the constant balancing act I have to perform.

I began the morning with a meeting of the university's board of directors. We discussed budget allocations for the upcoming academic year and the expansion of research programs. Ensuring that IST maintains its reputation for excellence and innovation is no small feat.

Later, I had the pleasure of speaking with some of the students during a campus tour. Their enthusiasm and curiosity never cease to amaze me. They're the heart and soul of this institution, and seeing their potential for greatness fills me with hope and pride.

In the afternoon, I met with a group of professors to discuss the ongoing research projects at IST. It's astounding to witness the groundbreaking work they're doing in various fields. These brilliant minds are the driving force behind our continued success.

As the day drew to a close, I found a few moments of solitude in my office. I pondered the immense responsibility that comes with leading a renowned educational institution like IST. It's not just about managing budgets and academics; it's about shaping the future, fostering innovation, and nurturing the minds of tomorrow's leaders.

My journey as the President of IST is an ever-evolving one, with its challenges and triumphs. It's a role I'm committed to, one that pushes me to strive for excellence each day.

Until tomorrow,
Rodri

Dear Diary,

The crisp autumn air and the sound of leaves crunching beneath my boots always bring back memories of childhood. Today, I took a leisurely walk in the park, allowing myself a break from the relentless demands of work. The golden hues of the trees and the soft whispers of the wind reminded me of simpler times.

I couldn't help but think about my grandmother, who used to bake the most delicious apple pies during this season. I miss her warm smile and the stories she used to tell. She had a way of making everything feel right in the world, even when life got tough.

As I sat on a park bench, I watched children playing and couples taking romantic strolls. It's funny how life keeps moving forward, no matter what challenges we face. In a way, it's comforting to know that the world can still be so beautiful despite the chaos.

I made a mental note to dig out my grandmother's apple pie recipe and try my hand at baking it. Maybe it will bring a sense of warmth and nostalgia back into my life.

Until tomorrow,
Rodri

Dear Diary,

Today was an emotionally charged day. I attended the funeral of a dear friend, Sarah, who lost her battle with cancer. It's moments like these that remind us of the fragility of life and how precious every moment is.

Sarah and I had been friends since our college days. We shared dreams, hopes, and countless adventures. She was a beacon of positivity and strength, even during her toughest times. Her unwavering spirit was an inspiration to everyone who knew her.

The service was bittersweet. Friends and family gathered to celebrate her life, sharing stories and laughter through the tears. It was a poignant reminder of the power of human connection and the impact one person can have on the lives of many.

As I left the cemetery, I couldn't help but reflect on my own life and the people who mean the most to me. Sarah's passing reminded me of the importance of cherishing those relationships and living each day to the fullest.

In her memory, I've decided to start a charity initiative to support cancer patients and their families. It's a small step, but I hope it can make a difference and honor the beautiful soul that Sarah was.

Until tomorrow,
Rodri

Dear Diary,

The pressure of our double lives has been intensifying, but having Eva by my side through it all has been both a blessing and a burden. We are thick into the project now, and the tunnel from the "Innovation Center" to the "Casa da Moeda" is slowly materializing from the pages of our shared ambitions. I sometimes wonder if it's sheer audacity or desperation driving us forward, but as I see the glint in Eva's eyes when we discuss the plan, I'm reminded of our collective determination.

Eva has been brilliant throughout, adding layers of sophistication to our scheme. It's a dance we're doing together on the precipice of risk and reward, a duet where both partners know every step intimately. But the danger is real. One misstep could mean a tumble into the abyss of repercussions.

In the midst of all this chaos, we still find moments of solace. I've planned the surprise trip to Bora Bora that she's always hinted at. It will be our sanctuary, a brief escape from our secrets. A place where we can leave behind the blueprints and coded messages and simply be two souls in love.

Every day, we make choices. Choices that will determine our fate and perhaps even change the course of history. But amidst all the decisions, plans, and whispers, there's one constant - our unwavering trust in each other. It's what makes us formidable. It's what makes us believe that, against all odds, we will succeed.

Until tomorrow,
Rodri
