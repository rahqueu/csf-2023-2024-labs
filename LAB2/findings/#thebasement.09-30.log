12:29 < ironcaesar> Hey Cat, is that you?
12:29 < CatSil> Hey Cesar, yeah, I'm here. What's going on?
12:30 < ironcaesar> You won't believe what I found out about that pendrive. 
12:30 < CatSil> I got curious when you said there could be someone related to me in that pendrive..
12:30 < ironcaesar> So, as I was going through the files, I found evidence of plans and blueprints of a tunnel under Arco do Cego. That's where you are interning right?
12:31 < CatSil> It is.. 
12:32 < ironcaesar> This is where it gets weird. There was this video of a guy named Fernando Silva also talking about the tunnel. That's when it hit me - It's you father
12:32 < CatSil> WTF it can't be...
12:32 < ironcaesar> it gets even weirder. Eva is involved too
12:33 < CatSil> So, you're saying my dad is involved in a project of a secret tunnel beneath Arco do Cego with the IST teacher Eva Rocha?
12:33 < ironcaesar> Yeah
12:33 < ironcaesar> I also got evidence of some weird company transfering loads of money to her. This is some serious shit. She could be incriminated for this!
12:34 < ironcaesar>  I always knew there was something shady about her
12:35 < CatSil> I'm just processing this.. I haven't talked to my dad for long, and he does have a troubled history.. but going from that to some secret tunnel project? That's madness
12:35 < CatSil> that could ruin my family's name
12:35 < ironcaesar> I know.. but he never liked you.. he never helped you paying for the Uni remember? you had to work for yourself on that.. Maybe this could bring some justice.
12:35 < ironcaesar> I mean, i could get rid of Eva, you could get rid of your dad.
12:36 < CatSil> How can you say that? I won't help you incriminating my own dad!!
12:36 < ironcaesar> He seems to have gotten himself into this mess.. As he always has. You have nothing to do with this.
12:37 < ironcaesar> I will make this go public. Eva needs to go. And I'm sorry that your dad is involved too. But I think its for the best of both our sakes. 
12:37 < ironcaesar> Otherwise, i fear we might be dragged into it...
12:37 < CatSil> Jesus.. so you will really put this on the big screens? 
12:38 < ironcaesar> This is now more than my hate for Eva.. This is about a possible schema using the tunnel to get into Casa da Moeda.. I think we must put this into the public!
12:38 < CatSil> I mean, it's a hard choice for me..
12:39 < CatSil> but if you really think it's the way to go, Cesar, I'll go along with it.
12:39 < CatSil> I'm just not entirely sure about this because, you know, it's my dad we're talking about. 
12:39 < CatSil> But maybe it's time he faces the consequences. Let's hope this pans out right.
12:39 < ironcaesar> I hope so
12:40 < ironcaesar> Igtg now
12:40 < ironcaesar> Stay safe Cat
12:40 < CatSil> You too, cya
